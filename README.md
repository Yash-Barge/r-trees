# R-Trees

This repository contains the implementation of R-Trees created as part of requirements for the course **CS F211: Data Structures and Algorithms** at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus in 2nd semester of academic year 2022-2023.

The implementation is based on the [paper](http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf) written by A. Guttam in 1984, written completely in C.

All algorithms described in the paper have been implemented, except searching and functions related to deletion, as these functions were not part of our problem statement.

## Data Input

The implementation only takes points as inputs, as such was required by our problem statement.

Points are described with x- and y-coordinate separated by a space, each point on a new line. A sample of data input can be found in `data.txt`.
